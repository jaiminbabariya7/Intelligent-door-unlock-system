Voice and Face Recognition system

      Our project is an intelligent door unlocking system. The system makes use of face recognition and voice authentication for verifying the visitor and unlocks the door on
authentication. The purpose of this system is to provide ease of access to owners and security. It can also be used for surveillance purpose because of the CCTV cameras used
in the system. This system can be used and deployed by security agencies. The system can be used at home, offices, societies etc. Once the user is registered into the system 
the system will detect their face using a video footage from CCTV camera, if the face matches with the database record then the system will proceed for voice authentication.
For voice authentication the visitor has to give a sample voice input that would be compared with the records in database. Once the voice is authenticated the door will be
unlocked automatically without any hassle of manual unlocking. Our system solves issues caused by manual unlocking of doors using conventional lock and key. The issues of key
management, duplicate key break in, thefts and break ins etc. are solved using our system. Hence, providing a safe and secure way of entering our house or buildings.
